Our current tech stack is:
- Huggingface transformers for NLP
- Refinitiv Eikon for the financial data
- AMFI for the MF data
- Streamlit for the front-end

The folder Finance use cases has a few code snippets that carry out different finance-related tasks and are used by us in our day-to-day.

Recent advances in AI and NLP have made this vision achieveable and a partnership with OpenAI will really help us on our journey.
